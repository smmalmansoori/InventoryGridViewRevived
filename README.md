# Dependencies

*You will need to install these separately*

* [LibAddonMenu-2.0](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu.html)

# Background

This addon is based on [Inventory Grid View](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info65-InventoryGridView.html) including fixes from [DunkleMaterie](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=42697) and [Baertram](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?u=2028) to make it work with the latest version of ESO. The code is publicly available on github.

* [Inventory Grid View Revived on GitHub](https://github.com/smmalmansoori/InventoryGridViewRevived)

I'm new to ESO AddOn development so it might take me a while to study the code and start fixing bugs. You can help by submitting issues and pull request in the github link above.

# Description

*Copied from [Inventory Grid View](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info65-InventoryGridView.html)*

Replace your default inventory's list view with a more compact grid view! The default list view shows 11-12 items at a time (in my case), so it can become a pain to navigate your inventory.

Grid view sacrifices detailed information for more pictures. Sometimes you want the detailed information, so I've included a button at the bottom that will toggle the grid on and off.

# Features

*Copied from [Inventory Grid View](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info65-InventoryGridView.html)*

* Grid view for your main inventory, your bank, your guild bank, your quest items, NPC's stores, AND the buyback screen!
* Toggle grid view on and off! Useful for when you need to scan with more information.
* Customizable grid size.
* Four default skins to choose from, with more available for download.
* Authors can submit their own skins for download. (See [Inventory Grid View Skin Template](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info583-InventoryGridViewSkinTemplate.html) for details.)
* Offsets item tooltips so they do not cover up the grid (can be turned off).
* Set scale of item icon animation.
* Works with Research Assistant and Advanced Filters!
